# Object Oriented Design (OOD)
# First time to write OOD
# OOD is like a package (i.e. object) with different functions

# Task: write a matrix object with several functions
# Initial function: m = Matrix(n) -> write a n*n matrix with all zeros 
# m.set(1,2,3) -> set position (1,2) as 3
# m.get(1,2) -> get the value of position (1.2)
# m.print() -> customise how to print
# m.rotate() -> clockwise rotate the matrix
